### Abstract:
Now skipping London. Accidentally flew into an airport a good bit outside Paris, were extremely confused and lost, survived amazingly, made it to hostel, walked a lot again, saw a bit of Paris. 

### Methods:

#### Change in plans/ first lesson in paying attention: 

While sitting in the Barcelona airport we figured we would be proactive and get our train tickets from Paris to London as per planned. The train tickets from Dublin to Cork were a standard price and super convenient, we assumed that this would be the same… 

…Nope. Turns out it is just like plane tickets where timing matters. So it was going to cost us a very-low $180 to take the train to London. After experimenting with busses we found that inexplicable the bus services would only allow you to book tickets from London to Paris but not the other way around. So after weighing the options we realized the cheapest option would be to instead fly straight from Paris to Dublin and skip London. The plane ticket was only $75 and Dublin is a much cheaper city than London to simply exist in. We really liked Ireland a ton and we didn’t actually have anything we specifically wanted to see in London so this works out well. Now we can do the Guinness tour and perhaps go North to see the coast a bit. 

#### Where are we?/ second lesson in paying attention: 
I read a fantastic book on the first part of this trip called The Martian by Andy Weir. It is a thrilling scientifically accurate story about an astronaut stranded on Mars and his attempts to stay alive — very recommended. In the book there is a passage that I felt fairly applicable to the beginning of our Paris leg of the trip: __“The [most surprising] moments in life are heralded by small observations”.__ 

Here is a quick list of our observations in chronological order and our initial thoughts/rationalizations of those observations after landing on our flight from Dublin to Paris: 

- We walked off the plane onto the tarmac, not a jetway — _okay no problem, we did this in Dublin too._ 

- When we entered the airport it basically looked like a medium size warehouse that they put a couple of seats in and called a terminal — _again, could just be a tiny terminal in the certainly large Paris airport._

- After walking through a single door and not having to do anything with customs at all we were outside — _again, maybe a small separate terminal?_

- The look of surprise on the face of the information desk lady after we asked how to get to downtown Paris — _maybe this was a silly question because it was obviously just out the door?_

- Walking outside the terminal and seeing it was smaller than the Burlington airport — _Oops._

At this point we realized we were not in Paris, or really that close. __Fun fact:__ was there was no internet in this metropolis of an airport so we couldn’t use our phones to check anything. 
	
We eventually figured out we had to get on a bus. Unfortunately, the bus was almost four times as expensive as the busses to and from airports in Dublin or Barcelona. 

Reluctantly we boarded a bus to what we could only hope was Paris. After an hour and 20 minute bus ride we finally arrived… on the outside of Paris. We were kinda far. 

Still no internet to check where our hostel was or anything. We walked into a hotel lobby and was blessed by a concierge directing us to the ultimate in comfort in this cold forbidding faraway land: McDonalds. 

Here blessed WiFi flowed like fountain beverages and we were saved. A quick check of google maps showed us just how far we had missed Paris with our airport:

Next time we will look a little more carefully at where we are actually flying into. 

In addition to our long bus commute we had a nice hour and 15 minute walk to the hostel from our station at McDonalds. Nothing like meeting a city walking through it hoping that your directions don’t take you through the bad parts of town.

Luckily, all sketchy parts were avoided and we only had one interaction with a homeless guy screaming at things. We rolled into our hostel about 3.5 hours after landing. Pretty good time. 

#### Actually doing things: 
After sleeping rather well we decided we should maybe explore this Paris place. Again, because we are stubborn without reason we decided to walk the whole journey instead of taking the metro or a cab. Bring on the long walks again. 

Our hostel is located a good bit north of the river Seine (all hostels seem to be for some reason) and most of the typical Paris things to do are on or south of the river. So after a 45 minute walk where we were greeted with some cool old buildings on the absolutely incoherently laid out streets…

![old]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/oldOne.JPG)

… we made it to our first destination: __The Cathedral of Notre Dame.__

![Notre Dame]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/notreDame.JPG)

This for me was absolutely amazing. First off it was free which was great but also I have always been a massive fan of Gothic style architecture and here I was at _the_ preeminent piece of gothic architecture.  It doesn’t get much more legitimate than a cathedral built in the 12, 13 and 14th centuries smack in the middle  of Paris’s medieval city. 

![Notre Dame inside]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/insideNotreDame.JPG)

While it might not be as big or ornate as the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona there is something absolutely powerful about standing inside of a building that people have been using for over 800 years. 

The stained glass was absolutely beautiful in a more micro manor compared to the Sagrada’s macro impact: 

![Notre Dame glass]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/smallStainedNotre.JPG)

It didn’t send patterns of light all over the building but it was simply mesmerizing with its patterns and various stories depicted. 

From Notre Dame we headed to the __Louvre.__ 

![Louvre Pan]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/louvrePan.JPG)

The actual size of the museum itself was astounding. It just kept on going and going along the river. I was really more interested in getting into the courtyard and seeing the glass pyramid though… 

![Louvre pyramid]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/pyramid.JPG)

Such a cool mixture of modern and classic architecture. 

We didn’t actually go into the Louvre, however, as it really seems like you need several days to appreciate it, it costs a decent amount and we had our sights set on a different destination…

![D’Orsay]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/museeDOrsay.JPG)

The Musee D’Orsay is a museum just up the river from the Louvre specializing in impressionist style artwork. This kind of artwork hit its heyday in the mid-late 19th century so what better place to put the museum than in an old train station: practically the mascot for that time period. 

![trainStation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/orsayInside.JPG)

There was no photography inside but we got to see dozens upon dozens of Monets, Manets, Pissaros, and Van Goghs. It was awesome to say the least. Peculiarly there was a lot of furniture too, which was confusing, but whatever. 

After this was done we had one more stop we simply had to make since we were in the neighborhood: 

![eiffel far]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paris/eiffelFar.JPG)

After a quick (30 minute) jaunt up the river we arrived at perhaps the most photographed object on the planet. It is possible that almost every single angle and condition has been photographed of the tower… So here are some more:

After we had gotten out all of our tourist needs we started the journey back. It was about an hour and a half walk, but through Paris, so it wasn’t _too_ bad. 

After returning to our hostel we journeyed out one last time to a French restaurant about a 10 minute walk away called Chez Papa’s. I got the Duck and Leeks paired with a red wine and Tyler got… a salad. It was all absolutely fantastic.

Now we’re back at the hostel about to go to bed. Our flight out to Dublin leaves tomorrow at 10:30pm, however, it is from that same airport so we will be leaving rather early for the bus. Potentially we will see the Arc de Triomphe, we shall see. 

 
### Result:
Feet are very sore from walking.

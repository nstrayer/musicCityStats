### Abstract:

Made it to Dublin, slept in the Dublin airport, braved the villainous Ryanair, survived, made it to Barcelona, sweat a lot. 

### Methods:

After a pleasant train ride back to Dublin from Cork we had a little time to wander around and get dinner. Whilst doing this we managed to catch this pretty cool light show on the side of a building:

After this we made our way back to the Dublin Airport where we set up camp (a much nicer experience than a night in the Boston Airport). We slept (actually no sleep was had) in the airport as opposed to a hostel like normal people because our flight departed Dublin to Barcelona at 6:15 in the morning and there wasn’t any transport to the airport that early, also it was free. In addition we wanted to play it safe because it was our first time taking … __Ryanair__…

#### Ryanair:
Flying around Europe on Ryanair seems akin to making a small deal with the devil. It is very very cheap (to go from Dublin to Barcelona was ~$50) but from the stories we have heard you may or may not get a seat/have to fly the plane yourself. There are a ton of fees that they make you pay for minor infractions as well. For example, if you forget to print off your boarding pass you pay ~$90 dollars, or if your bag weighs 10.01 Kilos (the limit is 10) you have to check it for a minor fee of $60. 

Hardy travelers we are we steeled ourselves for this experience, checking over our bag sizes and weights multiple times, we left early to get a good spot in line to find… that they don’t tell you the gate of the flight until less than 30 minutes before you board. This _does_ negate people literally camping out in front of the gate, but also tends to lead to congregations of persons around the info screens and potential stampedes to the gate. 

The second our gate was announced we briskly walked to it and set up shop. At this point we were planning how we would complain about the impending horrible experience. We boarded and flew to our destination with… no problems at all. We’re going to need more things to complain about. 

Once we arrived at the airport we quickly found an interesting fact about the people of this Catalonian city: they do not go to the bathroom. There was, from what we saw, a single bathroom in the whole airport. A single bathroom for an airport that 35 million people make their way through every year. 

Some quick facts about Barcelona as Tyler and I both are very interested in this kind of stuff: 

__Barcelona:__

	- City population of 1.6 million

	- Metro population of 5.4 million
	
	- Largest city on the Mediterranean
	
	- First language: Catalan. 

This last fact is the most frustrating. Not only do I have a very tenuous grasp of Spanish that I was planning on being overly confident about here, but turns out that’s not even the default language! Alas — back to being the americans. 

Once we made our way into the city center it became very apparent this was not Ireland anymore:

We walked for a while down La Rambla which is very much like Church Street in Burlington, except two miles long and 60 degrees in January. There were an endless array of narrow side alleys as well, all of them still packed with people, there are seriously a ton of people here.

We had breakfast at a place that we randomly stumbled upon in an exploration of one of these narrow alleys. None of the staff spoke English but we managed. Maybe we will survive.

From here we made our way to the water. At this point we were running on no sleep the past night and walking a good amount. So we most likely looked heavily intoxicated.

For both of us this is the first time seeing the Mediterranean:

After the water we walked a quick 50 minute jaunt back to our hostel, checked in and passed out. It is from my high bunk that I write this. We are about to head out to dinner at a local pizza place (Italian seems really popular here.)

### Result:
Nick and Tyler survive yet again, this time they don’t speak the same language as everyone. 

### Bonus(es):
__Architecture:__

I am a huge fan of architecture, and let’s just say this city is _pretty_ good for that. 

Antonio Gaudi is arguably one of the most powerful architects of all time and he has left his fingerprints all over this city. So far just in our wanderings we have seen two of his buildings: 

![gaudi 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/barcelona/gaudiOne.jpg)
![gaudi 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/barcelona/gaudiTwo.jpg)

Our hostel is located fairly close to the holy grail: [Sagrada Familia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia). Gaudi never actually finished this massive cathedral but the task continues to this day 133 years after the ground breaking. To say I am excited about seeing it is an understatement. 

__Insomnia:__

Why of why do people eat so late here?! Looking at restaurants to go to eat, none of them were opened, not because of the holiday, but because nothing opens here until 8:30! This is madness.

### Abstract
Went on a bus tour of north of Dublin, saw some amazingly beautiful countryside, soaked in Dublin/ Ireland for one last time, flying home. 

### Methods

#### Castle
We had heard from a few different sources that a very cool thing to do while in Dublin is… to get out of Dublin. Really the quintessential Irish existence is a quant one in a countryside. We definitely saw that in our journeys south to the Cork area. Going north of the city seemed like a good way to do that again. 

In our searches on how to go about getting north we found a cool little bus tour that took about half a day and included tour of a castle and a brief stop in a fishing village all for only 24 euro. We figured, “hey as long as we’re doing the tourist thing why not go all out?” And really, bus tours are as all out as you can go. 

We got on the bus in the heart of the city, first stop: the castle.

The castle was a residence for the Talbot family of dukes and duchesses of England. The land was given to the family by the King of England at the time (I forget which one but probably a George). The very same family lived in the castle for over 800 years. Only recently (1973) did it get turned over to the Republic of Ireland after the bloodline ran out. 

Like many castles it was a mish-mash of a bunch of different architectural styles, perhaps the most interesting being the original medieval tower. This is the main entrance to the castle and also the facade of that tower.

Again, how in the world is Ireland this green in January? (Hint: ocean currents.) 

Here is the view out of those windows above the door. The quintessential estate. Also, quintessential Ireland in that it was very windy and raining.

The decor in the tower was keeping with it’s time: black Irish Oak permeated.

Stunning, but a bit dark. I guess this was medieval times so the brightness of the room was the least of their worries. 

Moving beyond this tower to later additions we can see more modern styles. Like this dressing room…

Since we were on a bus tour and tight on time we didn’t get to fully explore the grounds which was a tiny bit of a shame. There were botanical gardens which would have combined my two favorite things in the world, gardens and castles. I guess it is reason to go back to Ireland. 

#### Howth
From here we went on to the fishing village of Howth. 

Ireland has a competition every year called the “Tidy Town Competition” in which they award a town the winner of tidiest town in the country. If that isn’t the most Irish thing ever I don’t know what is. Point being, Howth has won this competition many times, so it definitely has that classic Irish town charm going for it. In addition to some pretty nice views.

We had the amazingly awesome and oft-repeated-on-this-trip sandwiches in the pub for lunch. Who would have thought that the perfect lunch would simply take the form of a ham, cheese and tomato toasted sandwiches? The location of the pub wasn’t too bad being right on the marina. (That’s a sand dune behind the buildings.)

Upon getting back and grabbing dinner we again hit a few pubs at night in a hope to soak in just a little bit more Ireland on our last night. 

We woke up early this morning and packed up our bags in the hostel for the last time (it is going to be nice not living out of a tiny bag soon). From here we walked around for a little bit before making it to our bus stop.

Dublin truly is a beautiful and unique city, and Ireland a fantastic country. We will absolutely (and I am speaking without permission for Tyler right now who is passed out on the plane) be back. The landscapes and buildings and most importantly people were enchanting and amazing. 

One last thing: as we were waiting for our bus to the airport we noticed something very unusual for Irish winter… there were no clouds in the sky.

### Results
 How did all that time pass so quickly?

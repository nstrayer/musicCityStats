### Abstract:
Woke up, took a train to Cork, saw more of Ireland.

### Methods: 
This morning we woke up late after going to bed relatively early. Had breakfast at our hostel and then briskly walked to the train station in Dublin. Upon arriving and purchasing our tickets we literally ran to catch the train. 

Having only taken Amtrak prior, the train was very nice: quick, clean and modern. The ride took us through the Irish countryside that I always imagined.

After a 2 hour 30 minute train ride we were picked up at the train station by Glen: Tyler’s family friend. 

Cork is a beautiful city. Very much the Ireland that I envisioned. On our walk from the train station to downtown we walked down the River Lee:

After the river we walked to the main center of town which reminded me very much of Church Street in Burlington:

Now we are staying in a little town nearby Cork with Tyler’s family friends. We are sleeping in a ~150 year old house tonight:

Tomorrow we will be exploring the city and surrounding area.

### Result:
We’re in Cork.

#### Bonus:
Picture of our first dinner: Guinness Stew with (our first Irish) Guinness to drink.

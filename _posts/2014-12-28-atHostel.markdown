### Result(s):
We’ve made it to our hostel for the first night.

### Methods: 
We arrived very early (6 am local, 1 am EST) and took a bus into the city. Once there we wandered for a bit as nothing was open. In our wanderings we walked through the Trinity College Dublin Campus:

After this we went to a cafe and had the traditional Irish breakfast of a bunch of things that don’t make sense to go together (but taste really good):

After this we walked around some more and went to the Dublin Castle. Which contains the only still standing medieval architecture in the whole city (the center tower-ish thing, the other stuff are more contemporary additions). The walls are 15 feet thick!

From here we went to the Dublin City Gallery which has a large selection of contemporary art. 

Tyler slept…

a good amount:

After this we walked to where we are now: at our hostel.

We are going to take a quick nap and go grab dinner!

### Abstract
Made it to Dublin again, reluctantly did some touristy stuff, had a really fun time. 

### Methods

#### Guinness
Upon arriving once again entirely unscathed by Ryanair in Dublin  we slept on the ever comfortable benches at the airport McDonalds. There was no transport into the city as we got in pretty late. Upon walking up very disoriented and permeated with the smell of mcmuffins we made our way into the city and to the Guinness Storehouse to see the birthplace and home of Ireland’s national mascot. 

The Guinness complex is absolutely massive and takes up some pretty prime property in the city. After wandering through some (obviously cobblestone) streets we found our destination:

The tour was self-guided but awesomely informative and is set inside the seven stories of the old building they would store the beer in before shipping it out. 

You slowly make your way up learning about the ingredients and then the actual process of brewing and then the history of the company. All of it was absolutely awesome. 

Being a statistics major there was a plaque that I found rather interesting:

William Gosset is one of the most influential contributors ever to statistics. He developed the student t-test for comparing groups with small sample sizes by manipulating the shape of the curve that represents probabilities. He did this because in brewing it isn’t feasible to test a large number of batches to determine if the whole set is good. 

It is called the “student” -t test and not the Gosset t-test because Guinness at the time forbade their employees from publishing in scientific journals due to a previous employee publishing some trade secrets. So Gosset published under the pseudonym “student.” Changing the world without any appreciation. 

Another cool stop was the tasting room. This room was drastically out of sync with the rest of the facility and felt like entering a spaceship. They gave you little tiny little samples of different types of Guinness (there are three different kinds in total) and you could sip them amongst fog machines. Because, if there is anything that makes Guinness even better it’s drinking it in an abundance of fog with trippy new-age music playing.

The tour ends at the “gravity bar” which is a circular room with all glass sides on the top of the building with absolutely amazing views of the surrounding city and countryside. There they give you a nice pint to enjoy. We were very much fans.

#### Pub Crawl: 
After taking a nice nap to recover from our night in the airport  and then eating dinner we headed out to our second touristy (and alcohol based) event of the day. There is a pub crawl organized everyday for people staying in hostels. We figured it would be a good way to see some of the pubs that we wouldn’t know to go to. 

We were very impressed by the quality of the live music that we saw. This seems to be a much bigger thing in Ireland than in the US. We went to a total of five pubs and all were fun. If you are going to pub crawl anywhere Dublin is probably the best place to do it (there are over 1,000 pubs in this city of just over 500,000 people). 

Tyler was pretty popular with the ladies:

__Side note:__ Tyler and I don’t drink nearly enough to keep up with the locals or apparently the Brits. We’re just going to take that as a good thing. 

### Results
Gave into the pressure to do some touristy stuff. Had a good time.

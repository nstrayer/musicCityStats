### Abstract:
Went to Sagrada Familia, ate lots of fruit, ate lots of Tapas, saw some nightlife. Barcelona es una ciudad magnífica. 

### Methods:

The morning of the third we had the goal of waking up early and going hiking. Turns out pulling your third all nighter in less than a week leads to making it hard to adhere to designated sleep schedules. We slept until noon, at which time making the trek to the other side of the city to hike a mountain wasn’t going to work. Instead we ventured our way the other direction to the aforementioned (last post) Sagrada Familia:

__Interesting fact:__
It is well known that Antonio Gaudi was the architect for the Sagrada Familia until his death. However interestingly he was not the starting architect. However, the first architect only oversaw the laying of the initial foundation before Gaudi took over. Gaudi lived on site and worked on the Sagrada until his death. It is set to be completed around 2030. 

In all of my explorations of architecture the Sagrada was probably the most powerful in terms of artistic impact. It truly is hard to fathom it. 

From the incredible details of the outside:

To the absolutely astounding scale on the inside (those are people at the bottom):

From the outside it really looks like a mish-mash of a bunch of different styles and techniques…

…but once you stand in it and soak it in for a while you begin to see the genius that binds it all together. 

For example, depending on what time of day you go in you get different lights streaming in from the massive stained glass windows that play over the inside of the whole cathedral:

In addition the facades are detailed biblical scenes that draw the eye in the direction of the story.

It really is a building that you could sit and look at any given aspect for hours. Very big fan.

### Post Sagrada: 

After visiting the Sagrada we ventured back down to La Rambla to visit the market. At this hundreds of vendors are selling chocolates, fruits, meats and other wares. It is fairly awesome.

We wandered for a long while just absorbing it all. Very much a sensory overload. Everything is very cheap too. We got two very tasty juices (strawberry and coconut and another I can’t remember) for 1 euro (or $1.20).

After this, deciding that I had not had enough fruit I decided to get a nice cup filled with an assortment of fresh fruits, again 1 euro.

After this the only logical thing was to get some more fruit. Having had Lychee before it has always been a very rare treat. Something that if you have you have one or two, because they cost a lot. Not in Barcelona! Got a giant cup full of them for 1.5 euros. I never thought that I would finish eating Lychees fully satiated.

What would we do now that we were stuffed with fruit? Go eat some more food of course. After a small stop back at the hostel to recuperate we made out way out to a tapas restaurant for dinner. 

Tapas are all the rage in the states now with restaurants popping up all over the place, but in Barcelona they have a different flair. They are called Pinxtos and they are basically self serve tapas that are presented on top of a small piece of toast with a toothpick stuck in it. You go up and grab as many as you want and then at the end you bring your toothpicks to the register to pay based upon the number you have.

None of the waiters or waitresses spoke English (a surprisingly common trend) so we made due on my limited Spanish. A fun thing about that is not really knowing what we were eating at any given moment. 

After dinner we wandered around town and made our way into a beer bar (a rather rare thing in Spain). After a quick drink we walked around and found there are lots of little bars tucked away in alleyways entirely nondescript from the outside but absolutely packed with people on the inside. As a whole it seems like the Spanish are a very considerate people.

We made our way to bed at the early by Spanish standards 2 am and woke for more adventures (post forthcoming.) 
 
### Result:
Saw some amazing architecture, ate some amazing food, went to bed, woke up, did too much for a single post.

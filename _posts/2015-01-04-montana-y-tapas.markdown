### Abstract:
Actually woke up at a reasonable time, walked to a mountain, hiked it, saw things, came down, ate amazing food. 

### Methods:

#### The Mountain 
After our disappointing waking up performance from last night (1/3) we were determined to make it up this morning. We arose at bright and early 9:30 so we could go hike a mountain that conveniently resides in the city. From here we had breakfast at our hostel and then started out on our journey. We had the goal of walking down the main drag La Rambla and stopping at the market from yesterday to grab some food for lunch after our hike up the mountain. Unfortunately turns out the Spanish don’t like to work on Sunday and the market was closed :(. 

Undeterred we continued on and made our way to the mountain. In the map it is in the bottom left corner (Sants Montjuïc) and out hostel is located in the midst of the gold stars.

__Aside:__ 
Since we don’t have cellphone signal here what we do is load google maps up and scroll around the given city a bit to buffer the map into the phones memory. Then after that we find the places that we want to walk to and pin them as favorites. This makes them as little stars on the map view. We cache where we want to go before heading out of precious internet. This way we can find where we want to go using the google maps on our phones without internet.

The mountain was beautiful. It is very nice to have a situation where in a city as large as Barcelona you can really get away from the bustle and just relax in nature. It doesn’t hurt when the view from that nature is of a beautiful city and the Mediterranean…

We kept walking up and up and the views were amazing at all points.

At the top there was a castle used to defend the ancient city of Barcelona from sea-born antagonists.

#### Lunch
After a while we got tired and hungry and went back down into the city. There we stopped at one of the many shops that litter the side alleys that sell baguette sandwiches. ~$3.50 got us a delicious ~foot long ham and cheese (jamon y queso) sandwich on fantastic bread. We ate them sitting on a fountain in a beautiful square. 

After lunch we lazily made our way back up to our hostel. We have had a tendency while in Barcelona to wander. It seems like in any big city with a lot of tourists it is very easy to fall into the touristy areas and miss the heart and soul of the city.  We have made a concerted effort this trip to make our way to the less trafficked areas off the main streets. 

In Barcelona I feel we have found that soul in the many narrow alleyways that litter the city. It seems at every turn there are  people crowded into a bar watching a soccer game or sipping on sangria with friends.

#### Snack/  The Square
Speaking of soul, we stopped after lunch and before dinner in one of my favorite places we have seen this whole trip. It is a small square just a couple of blocks from our hostel. Our first night in Barcelona we went to dinner at a pizza place just off of this square and we have wandered through it a couple of times since. 

Today we stopped at a cafe in the square and got an order of Chocolate Caliente con Churros:

The view from out seats in the square was pretty fantastic. There is a very old and beautiful tower in the center of the square that is always filled with kids playing soccer and families gathering.

#### Dinner: 
After lounging in the square for a while and reading we made our way back to the Hostel to regroup before going to dinner. Glenn recommended a Tapas bar to us that we attempted to go to last night but it was too full. We tried again this night and only had to wait around 25 minutes. Let’s just say it was more than worth the wait. 

Last night we had pinxtos, or Catalan style tapas, tonight we had tapas in the more traditional sense and it was absolutely amazing. We ordered: Fried Potatoes, Fried cuttlefish, sautéed mushrooms, prawn skewers and sausage and white beans. In addition we washed it down with a nice half-liter of sangria. Each tapa was more amazing than the last.  Definitely one of the best meals of my life. Bravo España.

### Result:
We actually got up at a decent time, saw some beautiful views, ate some amazingly good food. 

### Bonus: 

#### Mopeds: 
One thing that has struck me is the number of mopeds here. It makes sense because the weather (thanks to that wonderful Mediterranean sea) is always very nice… but still, there are an amazing amount. They are allowed to park in different parts of the street than cars, which definetely helps further their popularity. Anywhere you look there are tons and tons of them: very cool.

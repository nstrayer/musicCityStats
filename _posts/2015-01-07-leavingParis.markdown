### Check in: 
We are currently sitting in a Starbucks on the outskirts of town waiting to take a bus to the tiny mistake airport up north. Our flight to Dublin is at 10:30pm Paris time, 4:30pm regular human time (EST), or 2:30pm too-far-from-any-water time (Mountain time). 

We also braved the metro in an attempt to act like civilized people. It was rather confusing but worked. Being from Vermont we would be much more comfortable with rapid transit in the form of moose drawn carriage but to each their own I guess. 

We saw a little bit more of Paris on our way to the bus station:

#### Arc de Triomphe:

It is a rather impressive spectacle. Very, very large (a Tyler for scale):

Overall at this point I am pretty sure that Paris has too many cool monuments for any one city. It’s just not fair to other cities really. But I guess they are already giving stuff away (see Statue of Liberty) so I won’t complain. 


### Data Supplement: 

Throughout the trip I have been taking photos and posting them here but I also have been using a cool little app called 360 Photo that allows me to pan around my environment and create an interactive view of the environment. Here are a few that I have made: 

#### Points of note:
- Make sure to zoom out by pressing (-) in the upper left corner of the frames to see the top. Alternatively, press the different views in the middle top or “Flat Image”.  

- Depending on what you are viewing this post on (iPhone, computer, iPad etc) it may be really slow. What I have the page doing is creating five new webpages and rendering them inside of the main page so it’s not exactly memory friendly. 

- You can use the links at the end of the post to view the images in their own window. This will work very well with an iPhone or other smartphone because you can activate __gyroscope mode__ and look around the scene by moving your phone around.

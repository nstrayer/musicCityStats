### Abstract:

Had a day in Cork City, brought in the new years, got lost, rescued, and slept a lot. Going to Barcelona soon. 

### Methods:

Upon again rising very late due to the incredibly comfortableness of the beds we are sleeping in we lazily made out way into Cork City via Glenn who deserves a Nobel Prize for his putting up with (and driving) us around these past few days. 

Upon getting in we walked around for a while went to a couple of Pubs (Irish Coffee is much stronger than I expected), and a very cool bookstore called Vibes and Scribes. The city is beautiful and feels much much larger than its 119 thousand people. 

In our wanders we ran into a couple locals: (They really do have Irish Wolfhounds here.)

It was a rather rainy and cloudy day so less photos than usual. 

__Irish quirk:__
One thing that we have become keenly aware of while here is that things that are the same can be different. Case in point: a common statement in a review of a pub in Ireland is “the Guinness is (good/bad) here.” At first we were very confused about it. The Guinness is all the exact same, right? Turns out it comes down to the way that they pull (pour) it. 

Good Guinness takes a while to get as the bar tender has to pour the first part of it, let it settle and then top it up over a series of successive pulls from the tap. A “good” Guinness will exhibit a phenomena known as “tiger stripes.” 

Here is a good Guinness that we got yesterday:

We stayed at a cool pub/ club called Old Cork directly downtown for new years. It was a fantastic way to bring in 2015 and we will remember for the rest of our lives.

From here we walked to the train station from the pub where we were to be picked up, unfortunately my phone’s GPS decided to break and we walked about a Kilometer past the train station. After the worlds shortest cab ride and the longest “30 meter” walk of our lives we managed to make it only 10 minutes after our scheduled meeting time. 

We slept very late this morning and are now about to take the train into Dublin to catch our first Ryanair flight. This one to Barcelona where we will be until Monday the 5th.

Can’t say we can complain about the weather we are supposed to get. Although it has been beautifully nice here in Ireland as well. 

We are so very grateful for the hospitality shown to us by Anthony, Jo, Glenn and Pearl during our time here in Cork County. It has been amazing. I hope we can come back and impose on you again soon!

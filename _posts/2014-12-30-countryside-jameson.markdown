### Abstract:
We traveled around the southern Irish countryside and went to the Jameson factory. Now we are going to dinner. 

### Methods:
After potentially the most comfortable night of sleep in our lives we woke up, had some traditional Irish white and brown bread. Upon finishing breakfast we made our way out through the countryside. We got to see some very beautiful views. 

The first place we went was the local castle. It has been beautifully restored and was just situated right off the road, very casually.

From here we continued on to some more beautiful views. Including the Cork harbor (called the second best natural harbor in the world). There was a beautiful cathedral right overlooking the harbor.

Inside was just as beautiful as the outside.

From here we went to lunch at in the town of Lismore. A quaint and bustling little town. We had traditional lunch of sandwiches and pints.

There was a beautiful castle (still occupied) in the town as well.

In addition to all our explorations we went to the Jameson Distillery and had an amazingly interesting tour.

Every bit of Jameson in the world (in addition so some other whiskeys) come from this distillery. Not too many photos from the inside but there were lots of very cool old buildings and distilling materials. 

This is the largest whiskey still in the world:

In a few minutes we are going to dinner in town.

Safely home and going to dinner now.

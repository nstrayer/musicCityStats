Welcome to our blog of (mis)adventures! Fair warning, this whole site may crash and burn as I am using this as an opportunity to learn a new website generating tool ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)). 

I am currently sitting in the Charlotte, NC airport soon to board a flight to Boston where I will spend the night. Tyler will arrive tomorrow morning and then we depart at 6:15 EST to Dublin one-way.
